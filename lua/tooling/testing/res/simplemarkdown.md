# This is just a heading

## Some of my todos
- [ ] my first task
- [ ] my second task
- [x] done task 1
- [x] done task 2

[[Linking to stuff]]

**Lets do a list**
- my first point
- my second point
- my third point
  - indented point
  - and even more

*How about something cursive?*

[[ContineousLinkExample]]

```dataview
special section with special code
should be handled in a special manner
so that we can see stuff
```

The rest is just a text section etc etc
To see how this behaves, but we're putting some `extra stuff` in to make it interesting.
And especially we are linking to [[other files]] to make it more relistic


### Secondary heading

%%also do a comment that is invisble%% and doesn't span the whole line


## More testing

%% this is a multiline comment
just to see if that would also work
currently not, but in the future it should
%% end of discussion

## Ordered lists?

1. This might be a bit tricky
2. Because different values, this might be more a regex case?
3. Because these numbers can just go up?
4. Or do i do it based on the .?
5. That could actually work
